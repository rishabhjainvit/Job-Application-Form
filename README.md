# 📝 Job Application Form

Welcome to the **Job Application Form** project! 🚀  
This is a full-stack application where users can apply for jobs by filling out a detailed application form. I developed the frontend using **React.js**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**, while the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**. This project showcases my ability to create a complete web application with a modern tech stack.
